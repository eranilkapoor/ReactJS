# Create React App

* Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a single page application in React.

* You'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run: node.js

```
npm i -g npx
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```
